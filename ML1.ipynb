The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n"

The separation of the data into a training portion and a test portion is the way the algorithm learns. We split up the data containing known response variable values into two pieces. The training set is used to train the algorithm, and then we use the trained model on the test set to predict the response variable values that are already known. The final step is to compare the predicted responses against the actual (observed) responses to see how close they are. The difference is the test error metric. Depending on the test error, we can go back to refine the model and repeat the process until we are satisfied with the accuracy."
